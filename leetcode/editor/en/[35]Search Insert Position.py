# Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the 
# index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were 
# inserted in order. 
# 
#  You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
# Output: 2
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
# Output: 4
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 10⁴ 
#  -10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 10⁴ 
#  nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order. 
#  -10⁴ <= target <= 10⁴
