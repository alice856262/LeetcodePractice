## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Identify the longest common prefix among a list of strings by iteratively comparing and reducing a candidate prefix.
- Start with the first string as the prefix and compare it with each subsequent string.
- If a mismatch occurs, the prefix is shortened until it matches or becomes empty.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Handle the base case where the input list is empty by returning an empty string.
- Step 2: Initialize the prefix using the first string in the list.
- Step 3: Iterate through the remaining strings in the list:
  - While the current string does not start with the prefix, shorten the prefix by removing its last character.
  - If the prefix becomes empty during this process, return an empty string immediately.
- Step 4: After all comparisons, return the refined prefix.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(S)
  - ```S``` is the sum of all characters in the input strings. 
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - The algorithm operates on the input data without requiring additional data structures.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Prefix Reduction:
  - Reducing the prefix character by character ensures accurate matching while maintaining efficiency.
- Empty String Check:
  - An early termination when the prefix becomes empty improves performance in cases with no common prefix.
- Edge Cases:
  - Input with one string should directly return that string.
  - Empty list or list containing empty strings should return an empty string.
