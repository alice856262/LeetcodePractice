## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- A stack is used to ensure that every closing bracket matches its corresponding opening bracket and that brackets are closed in the correct order.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Define a dictionary that maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
- Step 2: Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.
- Step 3: Iterate through each character in the string:
  - If it's a closing bracket:
    - Check the top of the stack to see if it matches the corresponding opening bracket.
    - If the stack is empty or the top element does not match, return False.
    - Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack.
  - If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
- Step 4: After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty:
  - If empty, return True (all brackets matched).
  - If not empty, return False (unmatched brackets remain).

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - ```n``` is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Worst case: all characters are opening brackets and are stored in the stack.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Stack Usage:
  - The stack efficiently manages the "last in, first out" requirement for matching brackets.
- Edge Cases:
  - An empty string is valid since there are no unmatched brackets.
  - Strings with only opening or only closing brackets are invalid.
- Error Handling:
  - Use a dummy value (```#```) for stack underflow simplify the logic for checking unmatched closing brackets.
