## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Absence Counting: Count the total number of ```A``` characters in the string to ensure the student was absent for strictly fewer than 2 days.
- Consecutive Lateness Check: Check for the presence of any occurrence of three consecutive ```L```s in the string, which disqualifies the student.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Initialize an ```absent``` counter to ```0``` and a boolean flag ```late``` to ```False```.
- Step 2: Iterate over every character in the string:
  - If the character is ```A```, increment the ```absent``` counter.
- Step 3: Iterate over the string from index 0 to ```len(s) - 2```:
  - If the current character and the next two characters are all ```L```, set ```late``` to ```True```.
- Step 4: Return ```True``` if ```absent``` is less than 2 and ```late``` is ```False```; otherwise, return ```False```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - The first loop iterates over all characters, and the second loop iterates over approximately ```n``` characters, resulting in linear time complexity.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Only a constant number of extra variables are used.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The algorithm first ensures the absence condition is met by counting ```A```s, then it verifies that the student was not late for 3 consecutive days by scanning the string.
- This approach is straightforward and efficient given the problem constraints, and it avoids unnecessary extra space by using only a few counters and flags.
