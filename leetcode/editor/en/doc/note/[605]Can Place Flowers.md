## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The goal is to determine if it is possible to plant ```n``` new flowers in the flowerbed without violating the rule that no two flowers can be adjacent.
- For each empty plot, **check whether its left and right neighbors are empty (or whether it is at the boundary)**. If both conditions are met, decrement ```n```. Return ```True``` if ```n``` reaches ```0```; otherwise, return ```False``` after processing the array.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Loop over each index in the flowerbed, check if the current plot is empty (```flowerbed[i] == 0```).
- Step 2: If the plot is empty, determine if:
  - Left Neighbor Condition: The plot is the first plot (```i == 0```) or the previous plot (```flowerbed[i - 1]```) is empty.
  - Right Neighbor Condition: The plot is the last plot (```i == len(flowerbed) - 1```) or the next plot (```flowerbed[i + 1]```) is empty.
- Step 3: If both conditions are met, plant a flower by setting ```flowerbed[i] = 1``` and decrement ```n``` by ```1```.
- Step 4: Immediately return ```True``` if ```n``` becomes ```0```.
- Step 5: After the loop, if ```n``` is still greater than 0, return ```False```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates over the flowerbed array once.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Only a constant amount of extra space is used.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The algorithm uses a greedy approach, planting a flower at the first eligible empty plot to maximize the available space.
- Boundary conditions are explicitly handled by checking if the current plot is at the beginning or end of the flowerbed.
- Early termination is used: if the required number of flowers is planted before the end of the array, the function returns ```True``` immediately, improving efficiency.
