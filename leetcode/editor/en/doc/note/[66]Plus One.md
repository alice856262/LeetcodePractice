## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The problem involves adding 1 to a number represented as an array of digits. Since the number is stored digit by digit, we handle carry propagation manually for cases where a digit becomes 10.
- Two methods were implemented: 
  - Iterative Approach with Carry Handling: Iteratively handle the digits from the least significant to the most significant, managing carry when needed.
  - Conversion to Integer and Back: Convert the array of digits into an integer, increment it by 1, and convert it back into an array.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
#### Method 1: Iterative Approach with Carry Handling
- Step 1: Start from the least significant digit (last index of the array).
- Step 2: If the current digit is less than 9, increment the digit and return the updated array.
- Step 3: If the digit is 9, set it to 0 and move to the next more significant digit (previous index).
- Step 4: If all digits are processed and a carry remains (e.g., all digits were 9), prepend ```1``` to the array to represent the new significant digit.
#### Method 2: Conversion to Integer and Back
- Step 1: Concatenate all digits in the array to form a single string representation of the number.
- Step 2: Convert the string into an integer and increment it by 1.
- Step 3: Convert the integer back into a string and split it into individual digits.
- Step 4: Convert the characters back into integers and return them in an array.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Iterative Approach with Carry Handling
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - ```n``` is the number of digits. Each digit is processed once.
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - No additional space beyond the input and output arrays is used.
- Conversion to Integer and Back
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Dominated by the integer conversion and string operations.
  - Space Complexity: O(n)
    - Additional space is needed to store the string representation of the number.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Iterative Approach with Carry Handling:
  - This is memory-efficient and directly operates on the input array. It is preferred for very large arrays.
- Conversion to Integer and Back:
  - It leverages Python's built-in capabilities for simplicity and is easier to implement but less efficient for extremely large arrays.
- Edge Cases:
  - Arrays consisting entirely of 9s, e.g., ```[9, 9, 9]```, which result in a new array of one extra digit, e.g., ```[1, 0, 0, 0]```.
  - Single-digit arrays.
  - Arrays without trailing 9s, where no carry propagation is required.
