## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Establish a **bijection** between characters in ```pattern``` and words in the string ```s```.
- Use two dictionaries (```pattern_dict``` and ```s_dict```) to store these mappings and check for consistency during traversal.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Split ```s``` into a list of words (```s_list```). If the length of ```pattern``` does not match the number of words in ```s_list```, return ```False```.
- Step 2: Initialize Two Dictionaries
  - ```pattern_dict```: Maps characters in ```pattern``` to words in ```s_list```.
  - ```s_dict```: Maps words in ```s_list``` to characters in ```pattern```.
- Step 3: Iterate through characters in ```pattern``` and words in ```s_list``` simultaneously using ```zip```.
  - For each character and word pair:
     - Check if the character exists in ```pattern_dict```:
       - If it does and its mapped word does not match the current word, return ```False```.
       - Otherwise, add the character-to-word mapping.
     - Check if the word exists in ```s_dict```:
       - If it does and its mapped character does not match the current character, return ```False```.
       - Otherwise, add the word-to-character mapping.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n) (overall complexity O(m + n) can be simplified to O(n), since ```m = n```)
  - Splitting ```s``` into a list: O(m), where ```m``` is the length of ```s```.
  - Traversing ```pattern``` and ```s_list```: O(n), where ```n``` is the length of ```pattern```.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Two dictionaries (```pattern_dict``` and ```s_dict```): O(n), where ```n``` is the length of `pattern`.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The algorithm handles edge cases, such as mismatched lengths of ```pattern``` and ```s_list```, immediately.
- Using two dictionaries guarantees both forward and backward mapping consistency.
