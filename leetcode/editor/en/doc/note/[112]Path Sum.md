## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree.
- Maintain a running ```targetSum``` that decreases as moving along the path, subtracting the value of each visited node.
- At each leaf node, check if the running ```targetSum``` equals the value of the current node.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Base Case:
  - If the root is ```None``` (the tree is empty), return ```False```.
- Step 2: Leaf Node Check:
  - A leaf node has no children (```root.left``` and ```root.right``` are ```None```).
  - If the remaining target sum equals the value of the current node, return True because a valid path is found.
- Step 3: Recursive Step:
  - Subtract the current node's value from the target sum.
  - Recursively call the function for the left child and the right child.
  - If either recursive call returns ```True```, propagate the result back up the recursion stack.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - ```n``` is the total number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal.
- Space Complexity: O(h)
  - ```h``` is the height of the tree. This is the space required for the recursion stack.
  - Worst case (skewed tree): ```h``` can be ```n```. Best case (balanced tree): ```h``` is ```log(n)```.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The solution leverages recursion to simplify traversal and checking conditions. Each recursive call reduces the problem size by focusing on smaller subtrees.
- The ```or``` operator combines the results from the left and right subtrees, ensuring the function returns True as soon as one valid path is found.
- The algorithm evaluates only one root-to-leaf path at a time, making it efficient for large trees.
