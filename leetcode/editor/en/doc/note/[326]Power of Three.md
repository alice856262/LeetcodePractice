## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Determine whether a given integer ```n``` is a power of three.
- Two methods were implemented:
  - Iterative Division: Iteratively divide ```n``` by 3. If at every division step the remainder is zero, and eventually ```n``` reduces to 1, then ```n``` is a power of three.
  - Mathematical Divisibility: Leverage the mathematical property that 1162261467 (which is 3<sup>19</sup>) is the largest power of three within the 32-bit signed integer range. If ```n``` is a power of three, it must be a divisor of 1162261467.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
#### Method 1: Iterative Division
- Step 1: Check if ```n``` is less than or equal to 0. If so, return ```False``` since powers of three are positive.
- Step 2: While ```n``` is greater than 1:
  - Calculate ```remainder = n % 3```.
  - Update ```n``` by performing integer division: ```n = n // 3```.
  - If the ```remainder``` is not 0 at any step, return ```False``` because ```n``` cannot be evenly divided by 3.
- Step 3: After the loop, if ```n``` has been reduced to 1, return ```True```; otherwise, return ```False```.
#### Method 2: Mathematical Divisibility
- Step 1: Ensure ```n``` is greater than 0.
- Step 2: Check if ```1162261467 % n == 0```. If this condition is true, then ```n``` divides the largest power of three within the 32-bit range.
- Step 3: Return ```True``` if the divisibility condition holds, otherwise return ```False```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Iterative Division
  - Time Complexity: O(log n)
    - With each iteration, ```n``` is divided by 3, leading to a logarithmic number of iterations.
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Use a constant amount of extra space.
- Mathematical Divisibility
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
    - The method involves a single modulo operation and a couple of comparisons.
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Use a constant amount of extra space.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Iterative Division:
  - This method is straightforward and easy to understand because it reduces the problem size step-by-step by dividing by 3.
  - It explicitly verifies at each stage that ```n``` is divisible by 3, ensuring correctness.
  - Although slightly slower for very large numbers due to the iterative process, its logarithmic time complexity is usually acceptable.
- Mathematical Divisibility:
  - This method is extremely efficient, running in constant time, as it relies on a simple mathematical check.
  - The approach is based on the insight that if ```n``` is a power of three, it must be a divisor of the maximum power of three in the given range (1162261467).
  - It requires the **precomputed constant** (1162261467), which is specific to the 32-bit integer range. Adjustments would be needed for different numerical limits.
