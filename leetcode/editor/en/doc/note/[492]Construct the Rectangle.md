## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Iterate through possible widths ```w``` starting from ```1``` to identify factor pairs ```(l, w)``` such that ```l * w = area```.
- By updating the answer with each valid pair, the algorithm converges to the pair with the smallest difference (since ```l ≥ w``` and the last valid pair found has ```w``` as large as possible).

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Initialize ```l = area``` and ```w = 1```. Also, initialize an empty list ```ans``` to store the final result.
- Step 2: While ```(area // w) >= w``` (ensuring ```l ≥ w```):
  - If ```w``` evenly divides ```area``` (i.e., ```area % w == 0```), update ```ans``` to ```[area // w, w]```.
  - Increment ```w``` by ```1```.
- Step 3: Once the loop finishes, return the final answer stored in ```ans```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(√area)
  - The loop iterates until ```w``` exceeds ```√area```, as beyond that the condition ```(area // w) >= w``` fails.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Only a constant amount of extra space is used for variables and the final result.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The algorithm exploits the mathematical property that the optimal factor pair (minimizing ```l - w```) is found when ```w``` is as large as possible while still dividing ```area```.
- Iterating from ```1``` upwards guarantees that the final valid factor pair found (just before ```w``` exceeds ```√area```) minimizes the difference between ```l``` and ```w```.
- This method is efficient even for large values of ```area``` due to its O(√area) time complexity.
