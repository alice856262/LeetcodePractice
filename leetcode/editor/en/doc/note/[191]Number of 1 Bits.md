## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The task is to count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of a positive integer.
- Two methods were implemented:
  - Bitwise Manipulation: Use bitwise manipulation to directly count the set bits by processing each bit of the number.
  - String Conversion: Convert the number to its binary representation as a string, and count the "1" characters.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
#### Method 1: Bitwise Manipulation
- Step 1: Initialize a variable ```count = 0``` to store the count of set bits.
- Step 2: While ```n > 0```:
  - Extract the least significant bit of ```n``` using ```n & 1```.
  - Add the result to ```count```.
  - Right-shift ```n``` by 1 to process the next bit.
- Return ```count``` as the total number of set bits.
#### Method 2: String Conversion
- Step 1: Initialize an empty string ```bits``` to store the binary representation.
- Step 2: While ```n > 0```:
  - Compute the remainder of ```n % 2``` to extract the least significant bit.
  - Append the remainder as a string to ```bits```.
  - Update ```n = n // 2``` to process the next bit.
- Step 3: Initialize ```count = 0``` to store the count of set bits.
- Step 4: Loop through each character in ```bits```, incrementing ```count``` for every "1".

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Bitwise Manipulation
  - Time Complexity: O(log n)
    - The loop runs once for each bit in the binary representation of ```n```.
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - No additional data structures are used.
- String Conversion
  - Time Complexity: O(log n)
    - For processing the binary representation and counting "1" characters.
  - Space Complexity: O(log n)
    - Store the binary string representation of ```n```.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Bitwise Manipulation:
  - This is more efficient in terms of space and is preferred for performance-critical tasks.
- String Conversion:
  - This is conceptually simpler but involves additional overhead from string operations.
