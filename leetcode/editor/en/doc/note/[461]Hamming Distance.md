## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- XOR Operation: Compute the XOR of the two integers to obtain a number where each bit is ```1``` if the corresponding bits of the inputs differ.
- Bitwise Counting: Count the number of set bits (```1```'s) in the XOR result using bitwise operations, which directly represents the Hamming distance.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Compute the XOR of the two numbers ```num = x ^ y```
- Step 2: Initialize a counter ```count``` to ```0``` to record the number of set bits.
- Step 3: While ```num``` is greater than 0, do the following:
  - Check if the least significant bit is set using ```num & 1``` and add the result to ```count```.
  - Right shift ```num``` by one (```num >>= 1```) to process the next bit.
- Step 4: Return ```count``` as the Hamming distance.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(k)
  - ```k``` is the number of bits in the integer, typically constant (e.g., 32 bits).
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Only a few extra variables are used.)

## Notes on Solving Process
- The solution utilizes bitwise operations to efficiently compute the Hamming distance without converting numbers to strings.
- By iterating through each bit of the XOR result, the algorithm directly counts differences in binary representation.
