## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Determine if a number is a "happy number" by repeatedly replacing it with the sum of the squares of its digits until the number becomes 1 or falls into a loop.
- To detect cycles, we keep track of previously seen numbers using a set.
- The process is based on repeatedly breaking down the number into its digits, squaring each digit, summing the results, and checking for termination conditions (either reaching 1 or detecting a loop).

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Initialize an empty set ```seen``` to keep track of previously encountered numbers.
- Step 2: Convert the input number ```n``` into a string representation to facilitate digit-wise processing.
- Step 3: Enter a loop until ```input``` equals 1.
  - If ```input``` is in ```seen```, it means the process has entered a cycle, so return ```False```.
  - If ```input``` not in ```seen```, add the current value of ```input``` to the ```seen``` set.
  - Calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of ```input```.
- Step 4: If ```input``` equals 1, exit the loop and return ```True```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
  - The number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in the number, and the sum of the squares of digits reduces the number over iterations.
- Space Complexity: O(log n)
  - The space used to store numbers in the ```seen``` set is proportional to the number of unique sums encountered.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The use of a set ensures efficient cycle detection, as membership checks and insertions are O(1).
- This approach effectively handles edge cases, including large numbers and numbers with repetitive digits.
