## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The longest uncommon subsequence between two strings is the entire string itself if the strings differ. If the strings are identical, every subsequence of one is also a subsequence of the other, so no uncommon subsequence exists.
- For strings of equal length, a simple character-by-character comparison is used to check if they are identical. If any character differs, the entire string is returned as the longest uncommon subsequence.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Check if the lengths of ```a``` and ```b``` are different. If they are, return ```max(len(a), len(b))```.
- Step 2: If the lengths are equal, iterate through each character index ```i``` from ```0``` to ```len(a) - 1```.
- Step 3: During the iteration, compare ```a[i]``` with ```b[i]```:
  - If a difference is found, return ```len(a)``` (since both strings are of equal length and differ).
- Step 4: If no differences are found after the loop, return ```-1``` (indicating that ```a``` and ```b``` are identical, so no uncommon subsequence exists).
 
## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Worst case: if the strings are identical, the algorithm performs a character-by-character comparison across all ```n``` characters.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - The solution only uses a few extra variables for loop iteration and comparisons, independent of the input size.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The algorithm quickly distinguishes between strings of different lengths, immediately returning the length of the longer string as the uncommon subsequence.
- For equal-length strings, a straightforward iteration and comparison are used, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
