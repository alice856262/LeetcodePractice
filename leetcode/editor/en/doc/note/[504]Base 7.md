## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Convert the absolute value of the number into its base 7 representation by repeatedly taking the remainder when dividing by 7.
- Build the base 7 string by prepending each digit, and then add the negative sign if the original number was negative.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Initialize an empty string ```ans``` to store the digits of the base 7 representation.
- Step 2: Compute the absolute value of ```num``` (denoted as ```abs_num```).
- Step 3: Check if ```num``` is ```0```. If it is, return ```"0"```.
- Step 4: While ```abs_num``` is greater than ```0```:
  - Calculate ```remainder = abs_num % 7```.
  - Update ```abs_num``` by performing integer division by 7 (```abs_num = abs_num // 7```).
  - Prepend the string of ```remainder``` to ```ans``` (i.e., ```ans = str(remainder) + ans```).
- Step 5: Return the resulting string ```ans```. If the original ```num``` is negative, prepend a ```'-'``` to ```ans```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log<sub>7</sub>(num))
  - The loop runs once for each digit in the base 7 representation.
- Space Complexity: O(log<sub>7</sub>(num))
  - Space is used for the output string, which contains as many characters as there are digits in the base 7 representation.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The algorithm efficiently converts a number to base 7 by leveraging modulo and integer division.
- Prepending digits ensures that the digits appear in the correct order without needing to reverse the string afterward.
- Handling the negative case separately by using the absolute value simplifies the conversion process.
