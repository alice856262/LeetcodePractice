## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The goal is to determine the number of cells in an ```m * n``` matrix that have the maximum integer value after performing a set of operations. Each operation increments all cells in a sub-matrix defined from the top-left corner ```(0,0)``` to ```(a-1, b-1)```.
- The maximum value is achieved in the overlapping region of all operations. This region is determined by **the minimum values of ```a``` and ```b``` among all operations**.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: If the list of operations (```ops```) is empty, return ```m * n``` because no operation changes the matrix (all cells remain at ```0```, the maximum).
- Step 2: Initialize two variables, ```a_min``` and ```b_min```, to ```m``` and ```n``` respectively. These will track the smallest ```a``` and ```b``` values among all operations.
- Step 3: Iterate over each operation ```[a, b]``` in ```ops```:
  - Update ```a_min``` to be the minimum of the current ```a_min``` and ```a```.
  - Update ```b_min``` to be the minimum of the current ```b_min``` and ```b```.
- Step 4: The overlapping region where every operation increments the cells is of size ```a_min * b_min```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(k)
  - ```k``` is the number of operations in ```ops```, since we iterate over all operations once.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Only a constant number of variables are used regardless of the input size.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The solution leverages the fact that the maximum value in the matrix occurs in the region that is incremented by every operation.
- By finding the minimum ```a``` and ```b``` among all operations, we identify the dimensions of this overlapping region directly, without needing to simulate the operations on the matrix.
