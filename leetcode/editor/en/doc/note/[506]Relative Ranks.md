## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The algorithm creates a copy of the original score array, sorts it in descending order, and then uses a dictionary to map each score to its corresponding rank. Special titles ("Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal") are assigned to the top three scores, while the remaining scores are assigned their placement number as a string.
- The original score array is updated in place by replacing each score with its rank, preserving the order of the original input.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Copy the original score array into a temporary array ```temp```.
- Step 2: Sort the ```temp``` array in descending order.
- Step 3: Initialize an empty dictionary ```score_dict```.
- Step 4: Iterate over the sorted ```temp``` array:
  - If the index is ```0```, assign ```"Gold Medal"``` to the corresponding score.
  - If the index is ```1```, assign ```"Silver Medal"``` to the corresponding score.
  - If the index is ```2```, assign ```"Bronze Medal"``` to the corresponding score.
  - Otherwise, assign the string representation of ```i + 1``` (i.e., the rank) to the score.
- Step 5: Iterate over the original ```score``` array and replace each score with its corresponding rank from ```score_dict```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
  - The sorting of the scores takes O(n log n) time, and the subsequent iterations over the arrays take O(n) time.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - A temporary copy of the score array and a dictionary for mapping scores to ranks are used, both requiring O(n) space.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The solution leverages sorting to determine the ranking order, which simplifies the process of assigning ranks.
- The use of a dictionary allows constant-time lookup for replacing the scores with their corresponding rank strings.
- Updating the original score array in place helps maintain the order of the input while efficiently generating the final result.
