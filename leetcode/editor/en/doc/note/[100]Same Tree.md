## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Compare two binary trees, ```p``` and ```q```, to determine if they are structurally identical and contain the same node values.
- The comparison is performed recursively, where:
  - Two empty nodes are considered the same.
  - If one node is empty or the values differ, the trees are not the same.
  - Both left and right subtrees must be identical for the trees to be considered the same.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Base Case for Empty Trees:
  - If both ```p``` and ```q``` are None, the trees are identical at this point. Return True.
- Step 2: Base Case for Mismatched Nodes:
  - If one of the nodes (```p``` or ```q```) is None while the other is not, or their values differ (```p.val != q.val```), the trees are not identical. Return False.
- Step 3: Recursive Comparison:
  - Recursively compare the left subtrees of ```p``` and ```q```.
  - Recursively compare the right subtrees of ```p``` and ```q```.
  - The result is True only if both the left and right subtree comparisons return True.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - ```n``` is the number of nodes in the smaller of the two trees. Each node is visited once during the recursive traversal.
- Space Complexity: O(h)
  - ```h``` is the height of the smaller tree. This accounts for the recursive call stack.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The recursive approach is natural for tree problems since trees themselves are recursive structures.
- Base cases handle situations where recursion terminates (empty nodes or mismatched values).
- The function stops further recursion as soon as a mismatch is detected, making it efficient for non-identical trees.
