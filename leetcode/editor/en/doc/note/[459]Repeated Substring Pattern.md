## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The algorithm leverages the property that if a string is composed of repeated substrings, **doubling the string will create overlapping regions where the original string appears**.
- By removing the first and last characters from the doubled string, we eliminate the trivial match and can accurately check if the original string is a repeated pattern.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Double the string by concatenating it with itself, forming ```s + s```.
- Step 2: Remove the first and last characters of the doubled string using slicing to obtain ```(s + s)[1:-1]```.
- Step 3: Return ```True``` if the original string ```s``` is found in the modified string; otherwise, return ```False```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n) on average
  - The substring search operation runs in O(n) on average.
  - Worst case: can be O(nÂ²) depending on the implementation.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Due to the space required to store the doubled string.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The solution is concise and elegant, utilizing a clever string manipulation trick that avoids explicitly iterating over all possible substring lengths.
- This approach effectively checks for repeated patterns by leveraging the inherent properties of string repetition and boundary manipulation.
