## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Use a frequency dictionary to count how many times each character appears in the ```magazine```.
- For each character in the ```ransomNote```, verify that it exists in the frequency dictionary with a sufficient count. Decrement the count as each letter is used.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Check if ```ransomNote``` is longer than ```magazine```. If yes, return ```False``` immediately because it's impossible to construct the note.
- Step 2: Iterate over the ```magazine``` and build a frequency dictionary where the key is the character and the value is the number of times it appears.
- Step 3: Iterate over each character in the ```ransomNote```:
  - If the character is not in the dictionary or its count is zero, return ```False```.
  - Otherwise, decrement the count for that character in the dictionary.
- Step 4: After processing all characters in the ```ransomNote```, return ```True``` since the note can be constructed.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(m + n)
  - ```m``` is the length of ```magazine``` and ```n``` is the length of ```ransomNote```.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Although the dictionary uses extra space, it is limited to **at most 26 keys** (for lowercase English letters).

## Notes on Solving Process
- The initial length check is a simple optimization to avoid unnecessary computation.
- The solution efficiently tracks letter counts using a dictionary, ensuring that each letter is only used once.
- This method guarantees that the ```ransomNote``` can be formed by decrementing the frequency counts and checking for insufficiency as soon as it occurs.
