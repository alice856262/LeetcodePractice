## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- For each word, determine if every letter belongs to the same row of the American keyboard by comparing the row of each letter to the row of the first letter.
- Use a dictionary mapping row numbers to their corresponding characters and list comprehensions to determine the row for each letter in a case-insensitive manner.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Define a dictionary ```keyboard``` where keys represent row numbers and values are the strings of letters in that row (all in lowercase).
- Step 2: Initialize an empty list ```ans``` to store words that can be typed using one row.
- Step 3: Iterate through each word in the input list ```words```:
  - Set a flag ```isSameRow``` to ```True```.
  - Determine the row of the first character by using a list comprehension on ```keyboard``` (store the result in ```first```).
  - For each character in the word, determine its row (using another list comprehension) and compare it with ```first```.
  - If any character's row does not match ```first```, set ```isSameRow``` to ```False```.
- Step 4: If ```isSameRow``` remains ```True```, append the word to ```ans```.
- Step 5: Return the list ```ans```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n * m)
  - ```n``` is the number of words and ```m``` is the average length of a word. Each letter is processed via a constant-time lookup over a dictionary of 3 keys.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - The output list ```ans``` stores up to ```n``` words, while the ```keyboard``` dictionary and temporary lists from comprehensions use constant space.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The algorithm ensures case-insensitive comparisons by converting each letter to lowercase before checking its row.
- Using list comprehensions to find the row for each letter simplifies the code but creates temporary lists for each lookup.
