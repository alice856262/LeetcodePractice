## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The goal is to reverse the characters in each word of the input string while preserving the original word order and spaces.
- This approach converts the string into a list of words, reverses each word using slicing, and then joins the reversed words back together with spaces.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Split the input string ```s``` into a list of words using the ```split()``` method.
- Step 2: Initialize an empty list ```ans``` to hold the reversed words.
- Step 3: Iterate over each word in the list:
  - Reverse the word using slicing (```word[::-1]```).
  - Append the reversed word to ```ans```.
- Step 4: Join the elements of ```ans``` into a single string with a space separating each word and return it.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Splitting the string, reversing each word, and joining the words each require linear time relative to the length of ```s```.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Extra space is used for storing the list of words and the list of reversed words, both proportional to the length of the input string.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The algorithm converts the immutable string into a mutable list of words for in-place modifications.
- It leverages slicing for an efficient reversal of individual words and maintains the original word order and whitespace.
