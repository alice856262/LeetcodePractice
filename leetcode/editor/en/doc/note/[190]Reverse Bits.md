## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The task is to reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
- Two methods were implemented:
  - Bitwise Manipulation: Use bitwise operations to efficiently reverse the bits.
  - String-Based Reversal: Convert the number to a binary string, reverse the string, and reconstruct the number.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
#### Method 1: Bitwise Manipulation
- Step 1: Initialize ```result = 0``` to store the reversed bits.
- Step 2: Loop 32 times (as the number is 32-bit):
  - Extract the least significant bit of ```n``` using ```n & 1```.
  - Append the bit to ```result``` by shifting ```result``` left by 1 and adding the bit using bitwise OR.
  - Right-shift ```n``` by 1 to process the next bit.
- Step 3: Return ```result``` after processing all 32 bits.
#### Method 2: String-Based Reversal
- Step 1: Convert ```n``` to a binary string by repeatedly taking the remainder when dividing by 2.
- Step 2: Pad the binary string with zeros to ensure it is 32 bits long.
- Step 3: Reverse the binary string. and convert back to an integer by iterating over the string and summing the contributions of each bit using powers of 2.
- Step 4: Return the reconstructed integer.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Bitwise Manipulation
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
    - The loop always runs exactly 32 iterations.
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - No additional data structures are used.
- String-Based Reversal
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
    - For processing 32 bits (building, reversing, and reconstructing).
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - For storing the binary string representation of the number.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Bitwise Manipulation:
  - Prefer for efficiency and simplicity in real-world applications, as it avoids the overhead of string manipulation.
- String-Based Reversal:
  - This demonstrates the concept of reversing bits but is less efficient due to string conversions and manipulation.
