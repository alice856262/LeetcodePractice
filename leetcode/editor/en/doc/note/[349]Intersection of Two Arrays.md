## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Set Conversion: Convert one of the arrays (```nums1```) to a set to eliminate duplicates and allow for O(1) membership checking.
- Unique Intersection: Iterate through the second array (```nums2```) and add elements found in the first set to a result set, ensuring that each intersecting element appears only once.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Convert ```nums1``` into a set (```s1```) to remove duplicates and enable fast membership tests.
- Step 2: Initialize an empty set (```ans```) to store the intersection results.
- Step 3: Iterate over each element in ```nums2```.
  - For each element, if it exists in ```s1```, add it to the result set ```ans```.
- Step 4: Convert the result set ```ans``` to a list and return it.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n + m)
  - Converting ```nums1``` to a set takes O(n), where ```n``` is the length of ```nums1```.  
  - Iterating through ```nums2``` takes O(m), where ```m``` is the length of ```nums2```.
- Space Complexity: O(n + k) (worst case: O(n))
  - The set ```s1``` uses O(n) space.  
  - The result set ```ans``` uses O(k) space, where ```k``` is the number of intersecting elements.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The use of sets enables constant-time membership checking, which makes the algorithm efficient for the given input sizes.
- By storing the intersection results in a set, the algorithm ensures that each element in the output is unique, meeting the problem's requirements.
