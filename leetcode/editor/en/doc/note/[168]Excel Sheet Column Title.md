## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The problem requires converting a column number to its corresponding Excel-style column title.
- The column numbering follows a base-26 system where:
  - 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, ..., 'Z' to 26.
  - 'AA' corresponds to 27, 'AB' to 28, ..., and so on.
- The key is to repeatedly extract the least significant "digit" in base-26, convert it to a letter, and prepend it to the result string.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Initialize an empty string ```result``` to store the final column title.
- Step 2: Process Each "Digit" in Base-26.
  - While ```columnNumber > 0```:
    - Subtract 1 from ```columnNumber``` to adjust for 1-based indexing.
    - Compute the remainder of ```columnNumber % 26``` to determine the current letter.
    - Convert the remainder to a letter using ```chr(remainder + ord('A'))``` and prepend to ```result```.
    - Update ```columnNumber``` by performing integer division by 26 (```columnNumber //= 26```).
- Step 3: Once the loop ends, return the ```result``` string.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log<sub>26</sub> n)
  - ```n``` is ```columnNumber```. The number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in the base-26 representation of ```columnNumber```.
- Space Complexity: O(log<sub>26</sub> n)
  - The space used is proportional to the number of characters in the result string.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The subtraction of 1 from ```columnNumber``` is critical to handle the 1-based indexing of the Excel-style columns.
- Characters are prepended to the result to build the column title from right to left, ensuring correctness without requiring a reversal.
- This algorithm is efficient and concise, directly leveraging the properties of base-26 arithmetic to compute the result.
