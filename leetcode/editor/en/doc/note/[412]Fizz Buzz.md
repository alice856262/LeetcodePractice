## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Generate a list of strings representing numbers from 1 to ```n```, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with "Fizz", by 5 with "Buzz", and by both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".
- Iterate over each number from 1 to ```n``` and use conditional checks to determine which string to append based on the divisibility properties of the number.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Initialize an empty list ```ans``` to store the resulting strings.
- Step 2: Iterate through each integer ```i``` from 1 to ```n```. For each number, check the following conditions in order:
  - If ```i``` is divisible by 3 but not by 5, append ```"Fizz"``` to ```ans```.
  - If ```i``` is divisible by 5 but not by 3, append ```"Buzz"``` to ```ans```.
  - If ```i``` is divisible by both 3 and 5, append ```"FizzBuzz"``` to ```ans```.
  - Otherwise, append the string representation of ```i``` to ```ans```.
- Step 3: Return the list ```ans```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates once through all numbers from 1 to ```n```, and each iteration does constant work.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - The output list ```ans``` stores ```n``` strings.
  
## Notes on Solving Process
- The conditions are checked in a specific order to correctly determine the appropriate string for each number.
- The use of modulo operations ```%``` allows efficient determination of divisibility by 3 and 5.
