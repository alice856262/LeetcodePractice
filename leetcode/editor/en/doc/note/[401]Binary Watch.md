## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Given the number of LEDs that are turned on, determine all possible times on a binary watch. A binary watch represents hours (0-11) and minutes (0-59) in binary.
- Iterate over every possible hour (0–11) and minute (0–59). For each combination, convert the hour and minute to binary, count the number of ```1```s, and check if their sum equals the given number of LEDs turned on. If it does, format the time appropriately and add it to the result.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Initialize an empty list ```times``` to store the valid time strings.
- Step 2: Loop over each possible hour from 0 to 11. For each hour, loop over each possible minute from 0 to 59.
- Step 3: For the current (hour, minute) pair, convert both to binary and count the number of '1's using `bin(hour).count("1")` and `bin(minute).count("1")`.
- Step 4: Check if the total count of ```1```s equals the given ```turnedOn``` value.
  - If it does, format the time string so that the hour is printed as-is (without leading zeros) and the minute is printed with two digits (including a leading zero if necessary), then append this string to ```times```.
- Step 5: Return the list ```times``` containing all valid time strings.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(1)
  - The algorithm iterates over a fixed number of possibilities: 12 hours × 60 minutes = 720 iterations, which is constant regardless of input size.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - The extra space used by the algorithm is constant (only a few variables and the output list, which is bounded by a constant maximum size).

## Notes on Solving Process
- Even though the method uses nested loops, the total number of iterations is fixed (720), so the algorithm runs in constant time.
- The solution leverages Python's built-in functions (```bin()``` and ```count()```) to compute the number of LEDs (```1```s) easily.
- This brute-force approach is acceptable due to the limited range of hours and minutes on a binary watch, ensuring the solution remains efficient.
