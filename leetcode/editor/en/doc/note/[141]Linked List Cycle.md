## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The problem involves detecting a cycle in a linked list.
- Two methods were implemented:
  - Hash Set: Use a hash set to track visited nodes and detect revisits.
  - Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm: Use two pointers (```slow``` and ```fast```) to detect a cycle using their relative positions.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
#### Method 1: Hash Set
- Step 1: Initialize an empty set ```visited```.
- Step 2: Traverse the linked list using a pointer ```current```.
  - For each node, check if it is in the ```visited``` set.
    - If yes, a cycle is detected. Return ```True```.
    - If no, add the node to the ```visited``` set.
- Step 3: If the traversal reaches the end of the list (```current``` becomes ```None```), return ```False``` (no cycle).
#### Method 2: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
- Step 1: Initialize two pointers, ```slow``` and ```fast```, both starting at the head of the linked list.
- Step 2: Move ```slow``` **one step** and ```fast``` **two steps** in each iteration.
  - If ```slow``` and ```fast``` meet at any point, a cycle is detected. Return ```True```.
  - If ```fast``` or ```fast.next``` becomes ```None```, return ```False``` (no cycle).

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Hash Set
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - ```n``` is the number of nodes. Traversing the linked list takes O(n).
    - Checking membership and inserting into the set are O(1) operations on average.
  - Space Complexity: O(n)
    - Worst case (all nodes are unique): the hash set can grow to O(n) size.
- Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Traversing the linked list with two pointers takes O(n).
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Only two pointers are used.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Hash Set:
  - Straightforward and intuitive but requires extra space for the hash set.
- Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm:
  - Optimized for space but requires understanding of the two-pointer technique.
- Edge cases to consider:
  - Empty list (```head``` is ```None```).
  - Single node without a cycle.
  - Small list with a cycle.
  - Large list with no cycle.
