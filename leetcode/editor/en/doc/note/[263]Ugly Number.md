## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- An ugly number is a positive integer whose only prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.
- Repeatedly divide the number ```n``` by 2, 3, or 5 while it is divisible by any of these factors.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Handle edge cases:
  - If ```n <= 0```, return ```False``` because negative numbers and zero are not considered ugly.
  - If ```n == 1```, return ```True``` as 1 has no prime factors and is considered ugly.
- Step 2: Use a loop to divide ```n```:
  - While ```n > 1```:
    - Check if ```n % 2 == 0```. If true, divide ```n``` by 2.
    - Else if ```n % 3 == 0```. If true, divide ```n``` by 3.
    - Else if ```n % 5 == 0```. If true, divide ```n``` by 5.
    - If none of these conditions are true, return ```False``` because ```n``` has other prime factors.
- Step 3: If ```n``` reduces to 1, return ```True```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
  - Each division by 2, 3, or 5 reduces ```n``` significantly. The number of divisions is proportional to the number of bits in ```n```, which is O(log n).
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The key insight is that dividing ```n``` by 2, 3, or 5 repeatedly eliminates these factors from ```n```.
- If ```n``` reduces to 1 after these divisions, it is an ugly number. If ```n``` cannot be further divided by 2, 3, or 5, then it has other prime factors and is not an ugly number.
- The algorithm handles edge cases explicitly and uses a straightforward loop to achieve efficiency.
