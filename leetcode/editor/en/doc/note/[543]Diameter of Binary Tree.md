## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes, measured in edges.
- Two methods were implemented:
  - Recursive Method: Use a helper function to compute the height of each subtree while simultaneously updating the diameter.
  - Iterative Method: Use a stack to simulate depth-first traversal and store subtree heights to calculate the diameter.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
#### Method 1: Recursive Method
- Step 1: Define a helper function ```depth(node)```.
  - If ```node``` is ```None```, return 0 (height of an empty subtree).
  - Recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees.
  - Update the diameter as the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees.
  - Return the height of the current subtree as ```max(left, right) + 1```.
- Step 2: Call ```depth(root)``` to traverse the tree and calculate the diameter.
- Step 3: Return the diameter.
#### Method 2: Iterative Method
- Step 1: Use a stack to simulate depth-first traversal and a dictionary to store subtree heights.
- Step 2: Push nodes onto the stack with a "visited" flag to ensure heights are computed after visiting children.
- Step 3: For each node:
  - If it has not been visited, push it back with its children.
  - If it has been visited, compute its height as ```max(left_height, right_height) + 1``` and update the diameter.
- Step 4: Return the diameter.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Recursive Method
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - ```n``` is the number of nodes. Visiting each node once takes O(n).
  - Space Complexity: O(h)
    - ```h``` is the height of the tree. The recursion stack requires space proportional to the height of the tree O(h).
- Iterative Method
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Visiting each node once takes O(n).
  - Space Complexity: O(h)
    - The stack holds up to O(h) nodes at any time, where ```h``` is the height of the tree in the worst case.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Recursive Method:
  - Efficient and straightforward but relies on the call stack, which may lead to stack overflow for very deep trees.
  - Ideal for most balanced trees.
- Iterative Method:
  - Avoids recursion depth issues by using an explicit stack.
  - Slightly more complex implementation but equally efficient. 
- Both methods ensure correctness and handle edge cases like empty trees or trees with only one node.
