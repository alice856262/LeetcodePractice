## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Use a dummy node to simplify the removal of nodes, including the head node if it matches the target value.
- Traverse the linked list while keeping track of the previous node to efficiently update pointers and skip nodes.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Create a dummy node and set its ```next``` pointer to the ```head```, which ensures consistent handling of node removal, including the head node.
- Step 2: Initialize a pointer ```current``` to the dummy node to traverse the list.
- Step 3: Enter a loop that continues while ```current``` and ```current.next``` are not ```None```.
  - If the value of ```current.next``` equals ```val```, remove the node by skipping it (```current.next = current.next.next```).
  - If the value does not match, move the ```current``` pointer to ```current.next```.
- Step 4: Return ```dummy.next```, which points to the new head of the modified list.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - ```n``` is the number of nodes in the linked list, as each node is visited exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - No additional data structures are used apart from the dummy node and a pointer.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The use of a dummy node simplifies edge case handling, especially when the head node needs to be removed.
- The solution avoids unnecessary pointer updates by only skipping nodes with the target value.
- The algorithm ensures correctness for various cases, including:
  - Empty list.
  - List with all or no nodes having the target value.
  - Mixed scenarios where some nodes need to be removed.
