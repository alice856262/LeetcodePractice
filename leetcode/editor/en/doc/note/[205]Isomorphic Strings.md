## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Determine if two strings, ```s``` and ```t```, are isomorphic by ensuring that:
  - Each character in ```s``` maps uniquely to a character in ```t```.
  - Each character in ```t``` maps uniquely to a character in ```s```.
- Both mappings are checked for consistency during traversal of the strings.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Check if the lengths of ```s``` and ```t``` are equal.
- Step 2: Initialize two dictionaries, ```s_dict``` and ```t_dict```, to store the mappings from ```s``` to ```t``` and ```t``` to ```s```, respectively.
- Step 3: Iterate through both strings simultaneously using ```zip(s, t)```.
  - For each character pair ```(s_char, t_char)```:
    - If ```s_char``` exists in ```s_dict``` and ```s_dict[s_char] != t_char```, return ```False``` (inconsistent mapping). If it doesn't exist, add the mapping ```s_dict[s_char] = t_char```.
    - If ```t_char``` exists in ```t_dict``` and ```t_dict[t_char] != s_char```, return ```False``` (inconsistent mapping). If it doesn't exist, add the mapping ```t_dict[t_char] = s_char```.
- Step 4: If the loop completes without inconsistencies, return ```True```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - ```n``` is the length of the strings ```s``` and ```t```.
  - The loop processes each character pair once, and dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) are O(1) on average.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - The dictionaries ```s_dict``` and ```t_dict``` store mappings for unique characters in the strings.
  - Worst case: each character in ```s``` and ```t``` is unique, leading to O(n) space usage.

## Notes on Solving Process
- This approach guarantees bidirectional consistency between ```s``` and ```t``` using two dictionaries, ensuring correctness.
- By checking both mappings, the algorithm avoids issues where multiple characters in ```s``` map to the same character in ```t``` or vice versa.
- The use of ```zip(s, t)``` simplifies the traversal of both strings, making the implementation clean and efficient.
