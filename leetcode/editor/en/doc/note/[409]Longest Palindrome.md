## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Determine the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed using the letters in a given string.
- Use the frequency of each character to determine how many pairs can be formed. Each pair contributes fully (i.e., an even number) to the palindrome length.
- If any character appears an odd number of times, one extra occurrence can be placed in the center of the palindrome.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Initialize an empty dictionary (```s_dict```) to count the frequency of each character in the string, a variable ```ans``` for the cumulative palindrome length, and a flag ```isOdd``` to ```False```.
- Step 2: Loop through each character in the input string and update the frequency dictionary:
  - If the character is already in the dictionary, increment its count. Otherwise, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
- Step 3: Iterate over each key in the dictionary:
  - If the frequency is even, add the entire count to ```ans```.
  - If the frequency is odd, add ```frequency - 1``` (the largest even number less than the frequency) to ```ans``` and set the ```isOdd``` flag to ```True```.
- Step 4: After processing all characters, if the ```isOdd``` flag is ```True```, add 1 to ```ans``` to account for a single center character. Then, return ```ans``` as the final result.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - ```n``` is the length of the string, since we iterate once over the string to count frequencies and then over a constant number of keys.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - The frequency dictionary contains at most 52 keys (for both uppercase and lowercase letters), which is considered constant space.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The approach leverages the fact that pairs (even counts) can always be fully used in a palindrome.
- By subtracting 1 from odd counts, we maximize the number of pairs, and a single extra character can be used in the middle if any odd count exists.
