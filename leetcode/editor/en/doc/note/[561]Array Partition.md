## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- By sorting the array, adjacent elements can be paired such that the smaller element of each pair (which will be at an even index) is as large as possible, maximizing the sum of these minimum values.
- After sorting, iterate through the array and sum up every element at an even index, which represents the minimum of each pair.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Sort the input array ```nums``` in non-decreasing order.
- Step 2: Initialize a variable ```ans``` to ```0```, which will store the cumulative sum.
- Step 3: Iterate over the array with a step of ```2``` (i.e., process indices 0, 2, 4, ...), and add the element at the current index to ```ans```.
- Step 4: Return ```ans``` as the final result.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
  - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and iterating through the array takes O(n) time.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - This method uses only a constant amount of extra space aside from the input array, assuming in-place sorting.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The approach leverages a greedy strategy by sorting, ensuring that the sum of the minimum values of each pair is maximized.
- Summing every other element after sorting directly computes the desired result without requiring additional data structures.
