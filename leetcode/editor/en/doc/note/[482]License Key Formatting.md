## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Preprocessing: remove all dashes from the input string and convert it to uppercase to standardize the format.
- Grouping: determine the size of the first group (which may be shorter than ```k```) and then divide the remaining characters into groups of exactly ```k``` characters, inserting dashes between them.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Remove all dashes from the input string and convert the resulting string to uppercase, storing the result in ```s_temp```.
  - If ```s_temp``` is empty after preprocessing, return an empty string.
- Step 2: Calculate the length of ```first_part``` as ```len(s_temp) % k``` if the remainder is not zero; otherwise, it is set to ```k```.
- Step 3: Initialize an empty string ```ans``` and append the first ```first_part``` characters from ```s_temp``` to ```ans```.
- Step 4: For the remaining characters in ```s_temp``` (starting from index ```first_part```), iterate through each character:
  - Every time the number of characters appended since the first group is a multiple of ```k```, append a dash ```-``` to ```ans```.
  - Append the current character to ```ans```.
- Step 5: Return the final formatted string ```ans```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates over each character of the processed string exactly once in a linear fashion.
  - While string concatenation can be costly, we assume here that the cost of each concatenation is amortized to O(1) per character, so overall the algorithm performs O(n) operations.
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Additional space is used for the processed string ```s_temp``` and the resulting string ```ans```.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The solution first simplifies the problem by preprocessing the input to remove irrelevant characters (dashes) and standardizing letter case.
- Handling the first group separately is crucial because its length may be less than ```k```, while all subsequent groups must have exactly ```k``` characters.
- The use of modulo arithmetic to determine when to insert dashes ensures that the formatting adheres to the problem constraints.
