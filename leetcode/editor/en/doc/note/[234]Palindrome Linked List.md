## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- A linked list is a palindrome if the values of its nodes read the same forward and backward.
- Two methods were implemented:
  - Convert to Array: Convert the linked list into an array and check if the array is a palindrome.
  - Efficient Reverse and Compare: Use the two-pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list, reverse the second half in place, and compare the two halves directly.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
#### Method 1: Convert to Array
- Step 1: Traverse the linked list and store its values in a list (```nums```).
- Step 2: Check if the list is equal to its reverse (```nums == nums[::-1]```).
- Step 3: Return ```True``` if it is a palindrome, otherwise return ```False```.
#### Method 2: Efficient Reverse and Compare
- Step 1: Find the Middle
  - Use two pointers (```slow``` and ```fast```). Move ```slow``` one step and ```fast``` two steps until ```fast``` reaches the end.
  - At the end, ```slow``` will point to the middle of the list.
- Step 2: Reverse the Second Half
  - Starting from the ```slow``` pointer, reverse the second half of the list in place.
- Step 3: Compare Both Halves
  - Use two pointers, one starting from the head and the other from the reversed second half.
  - Compare the values of the nodes in the first and second halves.
- Step 4: If all values match, return ```True```. Otherwise, return ```False```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Convert to Array
  - Time Complexity: Ο(n)
    - Traversing the linked list to create the array takes Ο(n), and checking if the array is a palindrome takes Ο(n).
  - Space Complexity: Ο(n)
    - Requires additional space to store the array.
- Efficient Reverse and Compare
  - Time Complexity: Ο(n)
    - Finding the middle takes Ο(n/2), reversing the second half takes Ο(n/2), and comparing both halves takes Ο(n/2).
  - Space Complexity: Ο(1)
    - Reversing the list is done in place, requiring no additional space.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Convert to Array:
  - This is simpler to implement but uses extra space to store the array.
- Efficient Reverse and Compare:
  - This is optimal for space and is preferred if Ο(1) space is required.
