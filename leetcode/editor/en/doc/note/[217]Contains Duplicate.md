## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The task is to determine if any value appears more than once in an array.
- Two methods were implemented:
  - Hash Set: Use a hash set to track seen elements and check for duplicates during traversal.
  - Sorting: Sort the array and check adjacent elements for duplicates.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
#### Method 1: Hash Set
- Step 1: Initialize an empty set ```seen```.
- Step 2: Traverse each element in the array ```nums```.
  - If the element exists in ```seen```, return ```True``` (a duplicate is found).
  - Otherwise, add the element to ```seen```.
- Step 3: If the traversal completes without finding duplicates, return ```False```.
#### Method 2: Sorting
- Step 1: Sort the array ```nums```.
- Step 2: Traverse the array and compare each element with the next one.
  - If any two consecutive elements are equal, return ```True``` (a duplicate is found).
- Step 3: If the traversal completes without finding duplicates, return ```False```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Hash Set
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Iterating through the array takes O(n).
    - Adding elements to the set and checking membership are O(1) on average.
  - Space Complexity: O(n)
    - Worst case (all elements are unique): the hash set requires O(n) space.
- Sorting
  - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
    - Sorting the array takes O(n log n).
    - Traversing the sorted array takes O(n).
  - Space Complexity: O(1) or O(n)
    - Sorting requires O(1) additional space if done in-place, or O(n) for algorithms like Merge Sort that require auxiliary storage.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Hash Set:
  - Simple and efficient for detecting duplicates during a single traversal.
  - Preferred when space usage is not a critical concern.
- Sorting:
  - Takes advantage of sorting to group duplicates together for easy detection.
  - Uses less memory if the array can be sorted in-place but has higher time complexity than the hash set approach.
