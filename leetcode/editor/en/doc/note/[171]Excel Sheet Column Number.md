## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The problem involves converting an Excel-style column title (a string) to its corresponding column number.
- Each letter in the string represents a "digit" in a base-26 numbering system, where 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, ..., and 'Z' to 26.
- The column title is processed in reverse order to simplify the computation of positional values using powers of 26.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Reverse the string ```columnTitle``` to process it from right to left.
- Step 2: Initialize ```result``` to store the accumulated column number.
- Step 3: For each character in the reversed string:
   - Compute the positional value as ```(ord(character) - ord('A'))```.
   - Multiply this value by 26<sup>i</sup>, where ```i``` is the position of the character in the reversed string.
   - Add this value to ```result```.
- Step 4: Return the final ```result``` after processing all characters.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - ```n``` is the length of the string ```columnTitle```, as each character is processed once.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - No additional data structures are used, and the reversed string is used inline.

## Notes on Solving Process
- Reversing the string simplifies the positional calculations, as the rightmost character corresponds to 26<sup>0</sup>, the next to 26<sup>1</sup>, and so on.
- The formula ```ord(character) - ord('A')``` ensures a correct mapping from letters to their respective numerical values in the base-26 system.
- This approach is efficient and leverages the positional value of each character to compute the result directly.
