## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- The main idea is to identify contiguous ranges of numbers in the sorted list and summarize them as strings.
- A range is defined by consecutive numbers that differ by 1. If a number doesn't belong to a range, it is treated as a single value.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Create an empty result list to store the range summaries. Record the length of the input list ```nums``` and initialize an index ```i``` to 0.
- Step 2: Iterate Through the List
  - For each number at index ```i```, treat it as the potential start of a range.
  - Use a nested loop to check if subsequent numbers form a continuous sequence by comparing ```nums[i + 1]``` with ```nums[i] + 1```.
  - Increment ```i``` while numbers are consecutive.
- Step 3: Record the Range
  - If the start and end of the range are the same, append the single value as a string to the result list.
  - Otherwise, format the range as ```"start->end"``` and append it to the result list.
  - Move to the next range by incrementing ```i``` to check for the next potential range.
- Step 4: After processing all numbers, return the result list containing all the summarized ranges.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
  - ```n``` is the length of the input list. Each element is processed at most twice (once as part of the range and once to move the index forward).
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - The space used is constant (excluding the output list ```result```).

## Notes on Solving Process
- This algorithm naturally handles edge cases (e.g., empty arrays or single-element arrays) due to its loop structure.
- It avoids unnecessary nested loops by leveraging the sorted nature of the input array to efficiently group consecutive numbers.
- The use of `f"{start}->{nums[i]}"` ensures a clean format for outputting ranges.
