## Algorithm Description
### Key Idea
- Each land cell is assumed to contribute 4 edges to the perimeter initially.
- For every adjacent land cell (up, down, left, right), subtract ```1``` from the perimeter of the current cell, since the shared edge is not exposed.

### Step-by-Step Algorithm
- Step 1: Determine the number of rows and columns in the grid, and initialize a variable ```perimeter``` to ```0```.
- Step 2: Iterate over each cell in the grid, if the cell is land (i.e., equals ```1```):
  - Add ```4``` to ```perimeter``` for the four sides of the cell.
  - Check the cell above. If it exists and is land, subtract ```1```.
  - Check the cell below. If it exists and is land, subtract ```1```.
  - Check the cell to the left. If it exists and is land, subtract ```1```.
  - Check the cell to the right. If it exists and is land, subtract ```1```.
- Step 3: Return the computed ```perimeter```.

## Algorithmic Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n * m)  
  - Each cell in the grid is visited exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space.

## Notes on Solving Process
- The solution uses a direct grid traversal, evaluating each cell independently.
- Adjusting the perimeter based on the presence of adjacent land cells prevents over-counting shared edges.
- Boundary conditions are carefully checked to avoid accessing cells outside the grid.
