# Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt. 
# 
#  The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all 
# left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not 
# have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as 0. 
# The rule is similar if the node does not have a right child. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 
# Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; 
# right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
# Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]
# Output: 15
# Explanation: 
# Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
# Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; 
# right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
# Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just 
# right child, so sum is 7)
# Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, 
# and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)
# Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [21,7,14,1,1,2,2,3,3]
# Output: 9
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
